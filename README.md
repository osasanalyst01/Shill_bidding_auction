## OVERVIEW
The goal of this project was to determine the behaviours that lead to fraudulent activities in bidding by exploring a dataset for shill bidding detection to 
generate insights to help eBay enhance their auction integrity and business strategy. The analysis used a decision tree and random forest models to identify fraudulent bids in the shill bidding dataset, and also construct linear regreation models to predict the final price or winning bid amount in the auction data. 
The models performed with a 99% accuracy.

## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
Shill bidding can inflate the prices of items which can distort the market and lead to inefficient allocation of resources. SHill bidding can also create fslse indicators on demand and supply. This can reduce customer trust on the E commerce. Buyers who realize they have been victims of shill bidding are likely to have a negative experience, reducing their likelihood of returning to the platform.  

## Data Understanding
There are two datasets in this analysis. The shill_bidding dataset which is visualised below. This dataset predicts shill behaviour. The second is the auction data that predicts final price.
